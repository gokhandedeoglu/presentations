Telerik NativeScript
==========

### Presentation-In-a-Box .. You'll enjoy this.

Everything you need to present on Telerik NativeScript - nicely wrapped up in a box. Showcases {N} framework features and highlights benefits for an easy conversation with developers. Polished decks are available in Web, PDF or PowerPoint formats - use whichever fits your needs. Demos include several sample apps, interactive tutorials and longer workshop materials.


### /// Have fun

Hope you enjoy building modern x-platform mobile apps with {N} as much as we do. Telerik NativeScript is a comprehensive mobile framework to leverage JavaScript for building native mobile apps, and hopefully, this presentation-in-a-box content helps you share your passion for NativeScript.

And remember - you're awesome. We mean that.

Sincerely

The Telerik Developer Relations Team
