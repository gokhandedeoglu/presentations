==========

### /// What is it?

The Friends sample app showcases various features of Telerik Backend Services. It is meant to be the most complete sample, showcasing integration of several products in a single app, thus getting the best out of the Telerik Platform.

The Friends sample is available for the following platforms:

### /// What it does?

Friends is a simple app that allows users to create an account and then post status messages on your wall.
When creating an account users must fill in their profile information. It consists of name, email, profile image, birth date and about text. Users can also update their profile later.
Once registered, users can post status messages (called "activities"). Everyone can see the activity of all other users. Also, users can post comments to an activity.
This is basically what the app can do. It is simple but it showcases many important features of the Telerik Platform.
