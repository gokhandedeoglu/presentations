Telerik Backend Services
==========

#### Presentation-In-a-Box .. You'll enjoy this.

Everything you need to present on Telerik Backend Services - nicely wrapped up in a box. Showcases features and highlights tooling for an easy conversation with developers.

### /// 20 Minute Cameo

If you have a short amount of time to do a lightning talk on Telerik Backend Services, here’s what we think are the most important points to hit:

* Explain BaaS (Backend as a Service)
* Explain where Telerik Backend Services fits 
* Stick to the slide decks entirely and walk through features
* Show how to get started with Backend Services
* Show off how to begin with Backend Services features
* Mention integrations
* Highlight flexibility and wrap-up

### /// 25-60 Minute Presentation

Ah, the comfort zone of a regular User Group or Conference session! Here’s what might make sense:

* Explain BaaS (Backend as a Service)
* Mention why BaaS is important for Mobile developers
* Explain where Telerik Backend Services fits 
* Run through the slide decks entirely and walk through features
* Show how to get started with Backend Services
* Show off how to begin with Backend Services features
* Demonstrate creating & consuming content over REST
* Use at least one Backend Services SDK
* Show at least one integration (Kendo UI, AppBuilder etc.)
* Show social User authentication
* Demonstrate Push registration & notification
* Highlight flexibility and wrap-up


### /// Have fun

Hope you see the need for robust BaaS solutions as much as we do. Telerik Backend Services provides  developers with end-to-end tooling for success and hopefully, this presentation-in-a-box content helps you share your passion for Backend Services.

And remember - you're awesome. We mean that.
